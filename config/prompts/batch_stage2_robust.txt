# === 1. SIMPLE (Linear) ===

# Software
A simple user authentication flow. User inputs credentials, System validates hash, returns Token or Error.
A password reset flow. User requests reset, System sends Email, User clicks Link, enters New Password.
An email subscription process. User submits email, System adds to DB, System sends Welcome Email.

# Physical
A gravity-fed water filtration system. Rainwater to Gutter, Gutter to Pipe, Pipe to Filter, Filter to Tank.
A manufacturing assembly line. Raw material enters Conveyor, Stamping Machine shapes it, Painting Station colors it, Packaging wraps it.
A traffic light sequence. Green light stays for 60s, turns Yellow for 5s, turns Red for 60s.

# Abstract
A logical syllogism chain. Premise A implies B. B implies C. Therefore A implies C.
A historical timeline of 3 events. Event A causes Event B. Event B triggers Reaction C.
An algebraic derivation. Start with Equation 1, substitute Variable X, simplify to Result Y.

# === 2. CYCLIC (Feedback) ===

# Software
A CI/CD pipeline with rollback. Commit -> Test. Fail? Notify Dev (Loop). Pass? Deploy. Monitor Health. bad? Rollback (Loop).
An event sourcing loop. User Action -> Event Bus -> Consumer updates View DB. View reflects new state to User.
A garbage collection mark-and-sweep. Scanner traces roots, marks reachable, sweeps unreachable, frees memory, waits for next cycle.

# Physical
A home thermostat. Sensor reads Temp. If Low, Heater On. Temp Rises. If High, Heater Off. Temp Falls.
The hydrological water cycle. Ocean water Evaporates into Clouds. Clouds Condense into Rain. Rain flows into Rivers. Rivers return to Ocean.
An engine combustion cycle. Intake valve opens, Piston moves down. Valve closes, Piston compresses. Spark plug fires (Combustion). Piston driven down. Exhaust valve opens.

# Abstract
The Hero's Journey. Ordinary World -> Call to Adventure -> Ordeal -> Reward -> Return to Ordinary World (Changed).
 The Scientific Method. Observe -> Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze. Data supports? Theory. Data rejects? New Hypothesis (Loop).
The Design Thinking process. Empathize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test. Test fails? Ideate again (Loop).

# === 3. HIERARCHICAL (Nested) ===

# Software
E-commerce Microservices. API Gateway routes to Product Service (Product DB), Order Service (Order DB), User Service (User DB).
A Kubernetes Cluster Architecture. Control Plane manages Nodes. Nodes contain Pods. Pods contain Containers.
A React Component Tree. App Component holds Header, Main, Footer. Main holds Sidebar and Content Area. Content Area holds Article List.

# Physical
The Solar System. Sun at center. Inner Planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth) orbit Sun. Earth has Moon. Outer Planets (Jupiter, Saturn) orbit Sun. Jupiter has many Moons.
A Biological Trophic Pyramid. Producers (Plants) at base. Primary Consumers (Herbivores) eat Producers. Secondary Consumers (Carnivores) eat Primary. Decomposers recycle all.
Human Nervous System. Central NS (Brain, Spine). Peripheral NS splits into Somatic and Autonomic. Autonomic splits into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic.

# Abstract
A Biological Taxonomy. Domain Eukarya -> Kingdom Animalia -> Phylum Chordata -> Class Mammalia.
A Corporate Org Chart. CEO leads VP Eng, VP Sales, VP HR. VP Eng leads Backend, Frontend, QA Teams.
A Decision Tree for Loan Approval. Credit Score > 700? Yes -> Income > 50k? Yes -> Approve. No -> Deny.
