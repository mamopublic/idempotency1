Use the 'graph TD' or 'flowchart TD' type unless specified otherwise.\n4. Use clear, descriptive node labels.\n5. Style the nodes to look professional (e.g., using 'classDef').\n6. Do NOT use reserved keywords (like 'end', 'subgraph', 'click') as class names. Use 'endNode' instead of 'end'.\n",

Do NOT mention that you are looking at a diagram or image. Just describe the system.\n5. Be precise and concise.\n"
